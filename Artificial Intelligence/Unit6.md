# Planning

### Q1. Explain with an example goal stack planning (STRIPS Algorithm)

- Goal stack planning is a fundamental approach in AI planning that utilizes a stack data structure to manage the process of achieving a desired goal. 
- Goal stack planning, also known as STRIPS  algorithm -Simple Theorem Rule Interpreter for Planning Systems
- It  break down complex tasks into manageable actions. 
-In goal stack planning, the problem is represented as a set of initial states, a set of possible actions, and a goal condition. The algorithm works by recursively breaking down the goal into subgoals and generating a plan to achieve each subgoal, until the original goal is achieved.

Let's illustrate goal stack planning with a simple example:

Consider a scenario where a robot needs to make a sandwich. The robot has several actions it can perform: 

1. Pick up bread
2. Pick up cheese
3. Pick up lettuce
4. Pick up tomato
5. Put bread on plate
6. Put cheese on bread
7. Put lettuce on bread
8. Put tomato on bread

And the goal is to make a sandwich, which consists of putting bread, cheese, lettuce, and tomato on the plate in the correct order.

Here's how goal stack planning works using the STRIPS algorithm:

1. **Initial State**: The robot starts with an empty plate and all the ingredients (bread, cheese, lettuce, tomato) are scattered around.

2. **Goal State**: The goal is to have a sandwich on the plate.

3. **Decomposition of Goal**: The robot decomposes the goal of making a sandwich into subgoals:
   - Subgoal 1: Put bread on plate
   - Subgoal 2: Put cheese on bread
   - Subgoal 3: Put lettuce on cheese
   - Subgoal 4: Put tomato on lettuce

4. **Action Selection**: For each subgoal, the robot selects the appropriate action from its action set to achieve that subgoal. For example:
   - Action to achieve Subgoal 1: Pick up bread, Put bread on plate
   - Action to achieve Subgoal 2: Pick up cheese, Put cheese on bread
   - Action to achieve Subgoal 3: Pick up lettuce, Put lettuce on cheese
   - Action to achieve Subgoal 4: Pick up tomato, Put tomato on lettuce

5. **Plan Execution**: The robot executes the plan by performing each action in the specified order.

6. **Goal Achievement**: Once all subgoals are achieved, the original goal of making a sandwich is also achieved.

7. **Termination**: The planning process terminates when all subgoals are achieved and the original goal is met.

This is a basic example of goal stack planning using the STRIPS algorithm. In more complex scenarios, the algorithm may involve handling uncertainties, constraints, and optimization criteria to generate efficient plans.

### Q2. Explain with example How planning is different from problem solving

Both planning and problem solving are crucial aspects of AI, but they approach achieving a goal in different ways. Here's a breakdown to illustrate the difference:

**Problem Solving:**

* **Reactive:** Deals with a current problem or unexpected obstacle.
* **Focuses on the end state:** Looks at the goal and figures out the steps to reach it.
* **Example:** Imagine a self-driving car suddenly encountering a roadblock. The car's problem-solving algorithm would detect the obstacle, decide the goal is to avoid it, and then figure out how to go around it.

**Planning:**

* **Proactive:** Creates a plan before taking any actions.
* **Focuses on the whole process:** Thinks about where to start, the goal, and all the steps needed to get there, considering possible obstacles.
* **Example:** A robot needs to clean a room. The planning algorithm would look at the room's layout (starting point), decide the goal (clean the floor), and then plan a sequence of actions (move in a pattern, avoid furniture, change cleaning modes for different surfaces).

In simpler terms, problem solving is like figuring out how to get out of a maze you're already in, while planning is like deciding how to navigate the maze before you enter it.

### Q5. Explain Planning in non deterministic domain

Planning in a non-deterministic domain is like making a plan for a trip knowing there might be surprises along the way. Unlike perfect weather forecasts, the outcome of actions in these domains can be uncertain. Here's how AI tackles planning in such situations:

1. **Conditional Planning:** This approach creates a plan with decision points. Imagine planning a camping trip, considering there might be a chance of rain. The plan would have options: "If it rains, go to the shelter; If it's sunny, enjoy the campfire." The AI considers different possibilities and plans actions for each scenario.

2. **Monitoring and Replanning:**  Since things can go unexpected, the AI keeps an eye on how things go. Imagine you packed a raincoat, but forgot your tent poles.  The AI might need to change the camping trip plans altogether, maybe finding a different outdoor activity..

**Examples of Non-deterministic Domains:**

* **Robot Navigation:**  Sensors might not always be perfect, and the robot might encounter unexpected obstacles.
* **Medical Diagnosis:**  Symptoms can be unclear, and test results might not give a clear answer.
* **Self-driving Cars:**   Traffic conditions can change quickly, and people walking might not follow the rules.

**Challenges of Non-deterministic Planning:**

* **Finding the Optimal Plan:**  With many possibilities, finding the best course of action considering all potential outcomes can be complex.
* **Dealing with Unknown Unknowns:**  The AI can't plan for everything, especially surprises it wasn't programmed to anticipate.

**Overall, planning in non-deterministic domains requires flexibility and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances. AI algorithms use a combination of conditional planning, monitoring, and replanning to navigate these situations effectively.**

By regularly reviewing and updating plans in response to changing conditions or new information, organizations can remain agile and responsive to opportunities and challenges.

### Algorithm for Classical Planning:
- Goal stack planning (Q1.)

### Q8. Explain with example State Space Planning
State space planning is a method used in artificial intelligence to solve problems by exploring the possible states of a system and finding a sequence of actions that lead from an initial state to a desired goal state. This approach is often used in classical planning problems, where the state of the world is represented explicitly, and actions have well-defined effects on the state.

### Example: Robot Navigation

Let's consider a simplified example of a robot navigating through a grid-world environment. The goal is for the robot to move from its current location to a specific destination while avoiding obstacles.

#### Problem Representation:
- **State:** The state of the robot can be represented by its coordinates on the grid.
- **Operators:** The actions available to the robot include moving up, down, left, or right, provided that it doesn't collide with obstacles.
- **Initial State:** The initial state is the robot's starting position.
- **Goal State:** The goal state is the destination location.

#### State Space Exploration:
1. **Initial State:** Suppose the robot starts at coordinates (0, 0) on the grid.
2. **Goal State:** The goal is to reach coordinates (3, 4).
3. **Search Algorithm:** The robot explores possible sequences of actions to find a path from the initial state to the goal state. This can be done using search algorithms like breadth-first search (BFS), depth-first search (DFS), or A* search.
   
   - **Breadth-first Search (BFS):** Explores all possible actions from the initial state before moving to the next level of states. It ensures that the shortest path is found but may require more memory.
   
   - **Depth-first Search (DFS):** Explores one path as far as possible before backtracking. It may find a solution quickly but doesn't guarantee the shortest path.
   
   - **A* Search:** Uses heuristic information to guide the search towards the goal state efficiently, often finding the shortest path while balancing time and memory requirements.

#### Plan Generation:
Once a solution is found, it represents a sequence of actions that the robot can take to reach the goal state. For example:
- Move right
- Move right
- Move down
- Move down
- Move right
- Move right
- Move right

#### Execution:
The robot executes the plan by following the sequence of actions, updating its position on the grid accordingly, until it reaches the goal state (coordinates (3, 4)).

In summary, state space planning involves representing a problem as a set of states and operators, exploring the state space to find a path from the initial state to the goal state, generating a plan based on the solution found, and executing the plan to achieve the desired outcome.

### Q9. Analyze various planning approaches in AI

**1. Classical Planning:**

* **Description:** Simple and well-understood, works well in fully observable, deterministic, static, and discrete environments. 
* **Analysis:** State-Space Search (BFS, DFS) and Planning Graphs efficiently explore possible states and actions to reach the goal.
* **Applications:** Classical planning is used in domains such as robotics, logistics, scheduling. 

**2. Hierarchical Planning:**

* **Description:** Hierarchical planning decomposes complex planning problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems organized in a hierarchical structure.
* **Analysis:** Hierarchical planning allows for modular and scalable problem-solving by breaking down tasks into hierarchies of abstraction levels. 
* **Applications:** Hierarchical planning is used in domains where tasks can be organized hierarchically, such as multi-agent systems, task planning, and workflow management.

**3. Probabilistic planning:**

* **Description:** Probabilistic planning deals with planning under uncertainty, where actions may have probabilistic outcomes or the environment is stochastic.
* **Analysis:** Probabilistic planning models uncertainty explicitly and considers the likelihood of different outcomes when generating plans.
* **Applications:**Probabilistic planning is used in domains such as robotics, autonomous systems, medical diagnosis, and decision-making under uncertainty.

**4. Learning-based Planning:**

* **Description:** Learning-based planning involves learning models or policies from data.
* **Analysis:** It enables adaptive and data-driven planning in complex and uncertain environments.It learn from data and improve planning performance over time.
* **Applications:**Learning-based planning is used in domains where learning from experience is essential, such as robotics, autonomous systems, game playing.


### Q10. Explain Classical planning and its advantage with example


Imagine you're baking a cake. Classical planning in AI is like having a perfect recipe that guarantees a delicious outcome, every single time. Here's why it's advantageous in certain situations:

**Classical Planning Explained:**

* **Simple and Clear:**  Classical planning assumes a perfect world for the AI. It knows everything about the starting situation (ingredients you have), what each step does (mixing, baking), and has a clear goal (a yummy cake). 
* **Guaranteed Success:**  With this complete information, classical planning can find a sequence of actions (recipe steps) that are guaranteed to reach the goal (perfectly baked cake).  Imagine following a detailed recipe where every step is precise –  you can't go wrong!

**Advantages of Classical Planning:**

* **Efficiency:**  Since the environment is predictable, classical planning algorithms can find solutions quickly and efficiently. It's like following a tried-and-tested recipe – you know exactly what to do and how long it will take.
* **Easy to Understand:**  The logic behind classical planning is straightforward, making it a good foundation for understanding more complex planning approaches in AI. 

**Example:**

Imagine a robot cleaning a room in a simple, predictable environment. Classical planning would involve:

* **Initial State:**  Knowing the location of dirt piles and furniture.
* **Goal State:**  A clean room with no dirt piles.
* **Actions:**  Move forward, turn left/right, pick up dirt.

* **Real World Isn't Perfect:**  The real world is messy! Sensors might be limited, things might change unexpectedly (like a spilled drink), and not everything is perfectly predictable. Classical planning struggles in these situations.

Even though it has limitations, classical planning is a valuable tool for AI because it provides a solid foundation for understanding planning problems and serves as a stepping stone for more complex planning approaches used in real-world scenarios.

### Q12. Write a short note on planning agent , state goal and action

**Planning Agent:**
1. Decision-Making Entity: A planning agent is an intelligent entity capable of making decisions based on its analysis of the environment and its goals. It assesses available options, generates plans, and selects actions to achieve desired objectives.
2. Utilization of Planning Algorithms: Planning agents leverage various planning algorithms and techniques to generate plans tailored to specific problem domains. These algorithms include classical planning, hierarchical planning, and probabilistic planning, among others.
3. Adaptive Behavior: Planning agents exhibit adaptive behavior by continuously assessing and updating their plans in response to changes in the environment or new information. They adapt their strategies to overcome obstacles and achieve goals efficiently.

**State:**
1. Representation of Environment: A state represents the configuration or snapshot of the environment at a specific point in time. It encapsulates all relevant information about the current situation, including the positions of objects, their properties, and any other relevant factors.
2. Foundation for Reasoning: States provide the foundation for reasoning and decision-making within the planning process. Planning agents analyze the current state of the environment to assess available options, evaluate their consequences, and formulate plans to achieve desired goals.
3. Dynamic Nature: States are dynamic and can change over time as a result of agent actions, environmental interactions, or external events. Planning agents continuously monitor changes in the environment and update their understanding of the state to adapt their plans accordingly.

**Goal:**
1. Desired Outcome: A goal represents the desired outcome or state that a planning agent aims to achieve through planning. It defines the objectives or targets that the agent seeks to accomplish within the environment.
2. Guiding Principle: Goals serve as guiding principles for planning agents, directing their efforts and actions towards achieving specific objectives. Planning agents formulate plans and select actions that align with their goals to maximize the likelihood of success.
3. Flexibility and Adaptability: Goals provide flexibility and adaptability within the planning process, allowing agents to pursue multiple objectives simultaneously or adjust their goals in response to changing circumstances. Planning agents prioritize goals based on their importance and feasibility, optimizing their plans to achieve the best possible outcomes.

### Q13. Explain different components of planning system

A planning system comprises several essential components:

1. **Problem Representation:** This is like the blueprint for the planning problem. It defines how the state and the goals are described in a way the system can understand. Imagine a robot cleaning a room. The representation might include:

- States: The location of dirt piles, furniture, and the robot itself.
- Actions: Move forward, turn left/right, pick up dirt.
- Goal: A clean room with no dirt piles.

2. **Search Algorithm:** This is the core engine that explores different possibilities to reach the goal. Think of it like the robot trying various cleaning sequences. Common search algorithms include:

- Breadth-First Search (BFS): Systematically explores all possible paths one step at a time, ensuring all options are considered. (Imagine the robot cleaning every corner methodically)
- Depth-First Search (DFS): Explores one path deeply until it reaches a dead end or the goal, then backtracks and tries another path. (Imagine the robot cleaning a specific area thoroughly before moving on)

3. **Knowledge Base:** The knowledge base stores domain-specific information, such as facts, rules, constraints, and heuristics, relevant to the planning problem. This information guides the planning process by providing insights into the structure of the problem domain and informing decision-making.

4. **Plan Generation:** Plan generation involves generating a sequence of actions that achieves the desired goals when executed in the environment. The planning system analyzes the problem representation, explores possible action sequences using the search algorithm, and selects a plan that satisfies the specified criteria.

5. **Execution Engine:** The execution engine is responsible for executing the generated plan in the environment by applying the selected actions and observing their effects. It interacts with the external world, monitors the execution process, and updates the state of the environment based on the executed actions.

6. **Monitoring and Adaptation:** Constantly evaluating plan execution, this component adjusts strategies in response to environmental changes or unexpected events, ensuring system resilience and effectiveness.
