# Virtualization in cloud computing

### Q1. Define virtualizations? Describe the advantages and disadvantages of Virtualization?

- Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of a physical resource such as a server, storage device, network, or even an entire computing environment.
- This technology allows multiple virtual instances, or virtual machines (VMs), to run simultaneously on a single physical hardware platform
- Each virtual machine operates as if it is an independent physical device with its own operating system and applications.
- In essence, virtualization creates a layer of abstraction that enables more efficient use of computing resources.
- This abstraction layer is typically managed by software called a hypervisor or virtual machine manager (VMM), which allocates physical resources to each virtual instance and manages their execution.
- It simulates the behavior of a physical device.

A Host operating system runs on the underlying host system. It is also known as ‘Hosted Hypervisor”. Such kind of hypervisors doesn’t run directly over the underlying hardware rather they run as an application in a Host system(physical machine). Basically, the software is installed on an operating system. Hypervisor asks the operating system to make hardware calls. An example of a Type 2 hypervisor includes VMware Player or Parallels Desktop.

Pros: Such kind of hypervisors allows quick and easy access to a guest Operating System alongside the host machine running.
Cons: Here there is no direct access to the physical hardware resources so the efficiency of these hypervisors lags in performance as compared to the type-1 hypervisors


Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors are both used to create and manage virtual machines (VMs) but they differ in their deployment and architecture. Here's a comparison between the two:

**Type 1 Hypervisor (Bare-Metal Hypervisor):**

* **Installation:** Directly installed on the server hardware, without a host operating system.
* **Focus:** High performance and dedicated virtualization. 
* **Resource Access:** Direct access to physical resources (CPU, memory, storage) for optimal allocation to VMs.
* **Security:** Generally considered more secure due to the lack of a host OS layer that could be vulnerable.
* **Management:** Often requires dedicated management tools or a separate console. 
* **Examples:** VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, Citrix XenServer.

**Type 2 Hypervisor (Hosted Hypervisor):**

* **Installation:** Runs on top of an existing operating system like Windows or Linux.
* **Focus:** Lightweight virtualization for development, testing, or personal use.
* **Resource Access:** Negotiates resource allocation with the host OS, potentially leading to less efficient utilization compared to Type 1.
* **Security:** Relies on the security of the underlying operating system, which can introduce additional vulnerabilities.
* **Management:** Easier to manage as it leverages familiar OS tools and interfaces.
* **Examples:** Oracle VirtualBox, VMware Workstation Player, VirtualBox.
