# Advanced Techniques in Cloud Computing 


### Q1. Draw and explain client server architecture of docker.

Docker is a open source platform that enables developers to automate the deployment of applications inside lightweight, portable containers. It uses a client-server architecture, allowing users to interact with containers via a command-line interface, while the Docker daemon manages the containers on the host operating system.

<img src="./images/docker.png">

Sure, let's draw and explain the client-server architecture of Docker, incorporating the specified components: Client, Server, Docker Daemon, Docker Objects, Host OS, and Docker Registry.


### Explanation of Components

1. **Client**:
   - The client is the interface through which users interact with Docker. This can be the Docker CLI (Command Line Interface), Docker API, or other tools like Docker Compose.
   - The client sends commands to the Docker Daemon.

2. **Server**:
   - The server hosts the Docker Daemon and manages Docker Objects.
   - It is typically a physical machine or a virtual machine running a Host OS.

3. **Docker Daemon (dockerd)**:
   - The Docker Daemon is a background service running on the server. It listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker Objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes.
   - It performs the heavy lifting of building, running, and managing Docker containers.

4. **Docker Objects**:
   - **Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
   - **Containers**: Runnable instances of images. Containers are isolated environments that run applications.
   - **Networks**: Allow containers to communicate with each other and with other parts of the system.
   - **Volumes**: Persistent storage that is independent of the container lifecycle.

5. **Host OS**:
   - The Host OS is the operating system on which the Docker Daemon runs. Docker uses the Host OS kernel to allocate resources to containers.

6. **Docker Registry**:
   - A Docker Registry is a repository for Docker images. Docker Hub is a public registry, while private registries can be hosted within an organization.
   - Users pull images from the registry to run on their containers, and they can also push images they have built to the registry for storage and distribution.

### Interaction Flow

1. **Client to Docker Daemon**:
   - The user, via the client (e.g., Docker CLI), issues commands such as `docker run`, `docker build`, etc.
   - These commands are sent to the Docker Daemon, which interprets and executes them.

2. **Docker Daemon and Docker Objects**:
   - The Docker Daemon manages the lifecycle of Docker Objects. For example, when a `docker run` command is issued, the daemon creates a container from the specified image.

3. **Docker Daemon and Docker Registry**:
   - When the Docker Daemon needs an image that is not available locally, it pulls the image from a Docker Registry.
   - Users can also push images to the Docker Registry using commands issued from the client.

4. **Containers and Host OS**:
   - Containers are run on the Host OS, sharing its kernel but isolated in terms of processes, file systems, and network interfaces.

This architecture allows Docker to be a flexible and powerful tool for containerizing applications, providing consistent environments for development, testing, and deployment.

It provides a robust and scalable environment for running containerized applications. Here's a detailed explanation of the architecture and working of Kubernetes:

**Kubernetes Architecture**

- The Kubectl CLI communicates with the Control Plane and Control Plane manages the Worker Nodes.
- Kubernetes has a client-server architecture and has master and worker nodes, with the master being installed on a single Linux system and the nodes on many Linux workstations.
- It has several key components that interact to manage containerized applications. These components are grouped into two main layers: the Control Plane and the Worker Nodes



#### 1. **Control Plane**
The Control Plane is responsible for managing the Kubernetes cluster. It consists of the following components:

- **API Server (kube-apiserver)**:
  - The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. It is like an initial gateway to the cluster that listens to updates or queries via CLI like Kubectl. Kubectl communicates with API Server to inform what needs to be done like creating pods or deleting pods etc. It also works as a gatekeeper. It generally validates requests received and then forwards them to other processes. No request can be directly passed to the cluster, it has to be passed through the API Server.
  
- **etcd**:
  - It is a key-value store of a Cluster. The Cluster State Changes get stored in the etcd. It acts as the Cluster brain because it tells the Scheduler and other processes about which resources are available and about cluster state changes.

- **Scheduler (kube-scheduler)**:
  - When API Server receives a request for Scheduling Pods then the request is passed on to the Scheduler. It intelligently decides on which node to schedule the pod for better efficiency of the cluster.

- **Controller Manager (kube-controller-manager)**:
  - The controller manager runs various controllers that regulate the state of the cluster, such as the Node Controller, Replication Controller, Endpoints Controller, and others. Each controller monitors the cluster’s state through the API server and makes changes to move the current state toward the desired state.

#### 2. **Worker Nodes**
These are the nodes where the actual work happens. Each Node can have multiple pods and pods have containers running inside them. There are 3 processes in every Node that are used to Schedule and manage those pods.

- **Container Runtime**:
  - The container runtime is the software responsible for running the containers. Kubernetes supports various container runtimes, including Docker, containerd, and CRI-O.

- **Kubelet**:
  - Kubelet, a agent, interacts with both the container runtime as well as the Node. It is the responsible for starting a pod with a container inside. It communicates with the API server to receive Pod specifications and reports back the node’s status.

- **Kube-proxy**:
  - It is the process responsible for forwarding the request from Services to the pods. It has intelligent logic to forward the request to the right pod in the worker node.
