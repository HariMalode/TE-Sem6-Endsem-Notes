# Security in Cloud Computing

### Q1. What are different risks in cloud computing and how to mange them?
- **Cloud Computing**:
  Cloud Computing is a type of technology that provides remote services on the internet to manage, access, and store data rather than storing it on Servers or local drives. This technology is also known as Serverless technology. Here the data can be anything like Image, Audio, video, documents, files, etc.
- **Need of Cloud Computing** :
Before using Cloud Computing, most of the large as well as small IT companies use traditional methods i.e. they store data in Server, and they need a separate Server room for that. In that Server Room, there should be a database server, mail server, firewalls, routers, modems, high net speed devices, etc. For that IT companies have to spend lots of money. In order to reduce all the problems with cost Cloud computing come into existence and most companies shift to this technology.
